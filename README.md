# BINARY SEARCH TREE VISUALIZER 

Welcome to the Binary Search Tree (BST) Visualiser! This tool is a dynamic and interactive web application designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of binary search trees. 
See how each node is positioned and how different operations affect the tree in real-time. Whether you're a student learning about data structures or a
developer looking for a quick reference, this visualiser makes complex concepts easy to grasp.

# Features

Interactive Node Insertion: Add new nodes to the tree and watch them find their correct position based on BST properties.

Dynamic Node Deletion: Remove any node by its value and see the tree automatically rebalance to maintain its integrity.

Node Search: Quickly find and highlight any node in the tree. The visualiser will show you the path taken to locate it.

Traversal Visualisation: Explore the three main traversal methods:

Pre-order: Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.

In-order: Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree. This traversal always outputs the nodes in sorted order.

Post-order: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.

ðŸš€ How to Use
Insert a Node: Enter a number in the input field and click the Insert button. Watch the new node being added to its correct location.

Delete a Node: Enter the value of the node you wish to remove and click the Delete button. The visualiser will handle the deletion and restructure the tree.

Search for a Node: Enter a value and click Search. The visualiser will highlight the node if it exists, showing you the search path.

Perform Traversals: Click on the Pre-order, In-order, or Post-order buttons to see the traversal process highlighted step-by-step. The output will be displayed in the designated area.


ðŸ’» Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure of the web page.

CSS: To style the visualiser and make it visually appealing.

JavaScript: The core logic for all BST operations and dynamic visual updates.
